# Minkowski Spacetime Calculator

## Alex Craig

This repository is the final project for **Phil 1.08 - Philosophy of Time and Time Travel**. It is a webapp that allows users to calculate the Minkowski spacetime interval between two events. The Minkowski spacetime interval is a measure of the separation between two events in spacetime. It is defined as:

$$\Delta s^2 = \Delta t^2 - \Delta x^2$$

where $\Delta t$ is the difference in time between the two events, and $\Delta x$ is the difference in the space between the two events.
